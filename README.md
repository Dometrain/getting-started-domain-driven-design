# Getting Started: Domain-Driven Design

Welcome to the ["Getting Started: Domain-Driven Design"](https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-domain-driven-design-ddd/) course on Dometrain! 

This repository contains the source code for the course, which you can use to follow along.

## Getting Started

The **main branch** contains the most up-to-date version of the code, reflecting the latest improvements, updates, and fixes. 

Each section in the course has folder in the repository. The folder contains the source code for the section, containing both a `/start` and `/end` directoryâ€”which aligns with the source code at a point in time as it relates to the course.
